# rotated-vec
_A dynamic array with O(1) access and O(âˆšn) inserts and deletes_

This is roughly a drop-in replacement for `Vec`, except that there is no deref to a slice, so underlying slice methods are unavailable. Many of the most useful slice methods have been ported.

Complete documentation is available at https://docs.rs/rotated-vec/.

This implementation is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Property-based tests are implemented using the [proptest](https://proptest-rs.github.io/proptest/intro.html) library.

If you have Rust [installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), you can run property-based tests from the repository root directory by typing `cargo test`.
